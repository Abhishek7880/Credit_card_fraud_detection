# Credit_card_fraud_detection
Problem statement:-
The aim of the project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. This is crucial from the bank’s as well as customer’s perspective. The banks cannot afford to lose their customers’ money to fraudsters. Every fraud is a loss to the bank as the bank is responsible for the fraud transactions.

The dataset contains transactions made over a period of two days in September 2013 by European credit cardholders. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions. We need to take care of the data imbalance while building the model and come up with the best model by trying various algorithms.
Steps:-
The steps are broadly divided into below steps. The sub steps are also listed while we approach each of the steps.

1. Reading, understanding and visualising the data
2. Preparing the data for modelling
3. Building the model
4. Evaluate the model

There are use various types of algorithms for best accurecy
1. The accuracy score achieved using Logistic Regression is: 99.87 %
2. The accuracy score achieved using KNeighborsClassifier is: 99.92 %
3. The accuracy score achieved using Logistic Regression is: 99.9 %
4. The accuracy score achieved using GaussianNB() is: 97.71 %
5. The accuracy score achieved using Decision Tree is: 99.91 %
6. The accuracy score achieved using Random Forest is: 99.94 %
